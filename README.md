# 🚧 CSES.fi Problem Set Solutions (Work in Progress) 🚧

## 📋 Overview
This repository contains solutions to the problem set available on [CSES.fi](https://cses.fi/problemset/), implemented in various programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java. Also please look into "Contributions" if you have achieved solving the problem in your desired programming language for which the solution has not been uploaded.

## 📚 Problem Set
The CSES problem set is a collection of algorithmic problems divided into categories such as dynamic programming, graph algorithms, sorting and searching, etc. Each problem has its own unique challenge and constraints, providing excellent practice and learning opportunities for algorithmic problem-solving.

## 📂 Structure
- Each problem solution is organized within its own directory.
- Within each directory, you'll find the solution files for different programming languages.
- A `README.md` file is available in each directory, providing a brief overview of the problem and approach used to solve it.

## 💡 Solutions
- Solutions are implemented in Python, C++, and Java to accommodate different programming preferences.
- Each solution is thoroughly tested to ensure correctness and efficiency.
- Detailed comments are provided within the code to explain the logic and approach used.

## 🤝 Contribution
Contributions to this repository are welcome. Especially if the problem doesn't have solution in your preferred programming language, and you have solved it and the solution isn't already available in the folder!
If you'd like to contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Implement your changes and test thoroughly.
4. Submit a pull request, clearly describing the changes made.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
Please note that while solutions provided here are correct, efficient, and thoroughly tested, using these solutions directly on CSES may violate their policy on plagiarism. It is recommended to use these solutions for learning purposes and to understand different approaches to problem-solving.
